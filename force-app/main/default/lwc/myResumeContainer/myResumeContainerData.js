    HEADING:"CAREER SUMMARY",
    DESCRIPTION: "I have 5+ years in the IT industry and experience as a Salesforce Developer. I've been very closely involved in the entire salesforce development lifecycle within the CI/CD pipeline, application design patterns, and integration patterns. When it comes to the tools, I fully take advantage of triggers, Apex classes, integration services, controllers, as well as Aura framework and lightning web components. I am also very much hands-on in the integration part of Salesforce, using Rest and Soap APIs. Highly skilled and dedicated software professional with expertise in object-oriented programming (Java) and test automation frameworks. Proficient in software development methodologies, particularly Agile/Scrum, with designing, developing, and executing automation scripts. Dedicated, highly motivated, and analytical Problem-Solver. A strong believer in teamwork, and collaboration with a cross-functional team mindset.",
